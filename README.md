📊 Customer Churn Analysis
This project aims to identify and visualize the key drivers behind customer churn for a telecom company. Understanding churn behavior is critical for improving customer retention and shaping business strategy. The analysis uses a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling to uncover actionable insights.

🔍 Objectives
Clean and preprocess customer data for accurate analysis.

Identify patterns and features that contribute to customer churn.

Visualize key trends to support decision-making.

Recommend strategies to reduce churn.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📈 Key Findings
Overall churn rate: ~26.5% of customers have left the service.

Senior citizens churn at a higher rate than younger users.

Month-to-month contracts are most associated with churn, while one- and two-year contracts have significantly better retention.

Customers without services like online security, tech support, or streaming options are more likely to churn.

Electronic check users have the highest churn rate among all payment methods.

Short-tenured customers (new subscribers) are more likely to churn than long-term users.

📌 Recommendations
Encourage long-term contracts with loyalty benefits.

Offer value-added service bundles to reduce churn risk.

Enhance support and onboarding for senior customers.

Reevaluate the electronic check payment experience or incentivize more stable alternatives.
